# CLAUDE.md Improver

Audit, evaluate, and improve CLAUDE.md files across a codebase to ensure PI has optimal project context.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Context Baseline Review

**No file reads in this phase.** Use only what is already loaded in this session's context.

**Purpose:** This baseline review is the primary evidence for scoring Criterion 7 (Auto-Delivered Overlap) in Phase 3. Its goal is to identify which information categories are already delivered automatically by SuPi extensions or native pi, so you do NOT recommend adding that same content to CLAUDE.md. If you skip this step, you will inflate scores and propose redundant additions that already appear in every session.

**Step 1 — Detect auto-injected sources.** Scan the conversation context for:

| Source identifier | What to look for | Typical content |
|-------------------|------------------|---------------|
| `supi-code-intelligence` | Workspace module graphs, package lists, dependency arrows, file counts | `## Modules` tables, architecture overviews, root directory trees |
| `supi-claude-md` | `<extension-context source="supi-claude-md">` blocks | Subdirectory CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md content already injected below cwd |
| `native-pi` | Root CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md loaded into the system prompt | Project-wide instructions from the repository root |
| Other extensions | `<extension-context source="...">` blocks | Any other extension-injected context |

**Step 2 — Build the baseline.** For each source found, record what it already covers:

| Source | Content Category | Already Covers | Scope |
|--------|------------------|----------------|-------|
| `supi-code-intelligence` | Module graph | Package names, descriptions, dependency relationships | **Root-level** |
| `supi-code-intelligence` | Workspace overview | File counts, root directory tree, top-level landmarks | **Root-level** |
| `supi-claude-md` | Subdirectory instructions | `packages/*/CLAUDE.md` content injected during this session | **Package-specific** |
| `native-pi` | Root instructions | `./CLAUDE.md`, `./AGENTS.md` in system prompt | **Root-level** |

Add rows for any additional categories visible in context.

**Step 3 — Classify redundancy risk by scope.** Use the table above to categorize:

- **Root-level high risk** (already auto-delivered; do NOT recommend for root `./CLAUDE.md`):
  - Package/module inventories (from `supi-code-intelligence`)
  - Package layout / project structure sections that just list packages with descriptions (from `supi-code-intelligence`)
  - Root directory trees and file counts (from `supi-code-intelligence`)
  - Dependency graphs from manifests (from `supi-code-intelligence`)
  - High-level architecture without project-specific reasoning (from `supi-code-intelligence`)

- **Package-specific high risk** (already auto-delivered; do NOT recommend for that package's `CLAUDE.md`):
  - Subdirectory CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md already injected by `supi-claude-md` during this session

- **Low risk** (not auto-delivered; safe to recommend in CLAUDE.md at any scope):
  - Non-obvious commands and workflows (not routine build/test/lint — those are in package.json)
  - Gotchas and non-obvious patterns
  - Cross-package conventions not obvious from manifests
  - Curated "start here" guidance with ownership or boundary reasoning
  - Project-specific exceptions to generic rules

**Step 4 — Output the baseline.** Produce this structured overview before proceeding to Phase 2:

```markdown
## Phase 1 Baseline Review

### SuPi Detected: yes / no

### Auto-Injected Content by Source

| Source | Content Category | Already Covers | Scope |
|--------|------------------|----------------|-------|
| ... | ... | ... | Root / Package-specific |

### Redundancy Risk Assessment

- **Root-level high risk** (do NOT recommend for root `./CLAUDE.md`):
  - [List categories]
- **Package-specific high risk** (do NOT recommend for matching package `CLAUDE.md`):
  - [List categories]
- **Low risk** (safe to recommend):
  - [List categories]
```

**Note:** This review is intentionally approximate — it compares against the context already visible to you, not the literal hidden system prompt. If no SuPi-delivered context is visible in the conversation, the baseline is empty and this phase is a no-op.

### Phase 2: Discovery

Now read files from disk. Find all CLAUDE.md files in the repository:

```bash
find . -name "CLAUDE.md" -o -name ".claude.md" -o -name ".claude.local.md" 2>/dev/null | head -50
```

**File Types & Locations:**

| Type | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Project root | `./CLAUDE.md` | Primary project context (checked into git, shared with team) |
| Local overrides | `./.claude.local.md` | Personal/local settings (gitignored, not shared) |
| Global defaults | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | User-wide defaults across all projects |
| Package-specific | `./packages/*/CLAUDE.md` | Module-level context in monorepos |
| Subdirectory | Any nested location | Feature/domain-specific context |

**Note:** PI auto-discovers CLAUDE.md files in parent directories, making monorepo setups work automatically.

### Phase 3: Quality Assessment

For each CLAUDE.md file found in Phase 2, evaluate against quality criteria, incorporating the Phase 1 baseline review results. See [references/quality-criteria.md](references/quality-criteria.md) for detailed rubrics.

**Quick Assessment Checklist:**

| Criterion | Weight | Check |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Commands/workflows documented | High | Are non-obvious commands/workflows captured (not routine build/test)? |
| Architecture clarity | High | Can PI understand the codebase structure? |
| Non-obvious patterns | Medium | Are gotchas and quirks documented? |
| Conciseness | Medium | No verbose explanations or obvious info? |
| Currency | High | Does it reflect current codebase state? |
| Actionability | High | Are instructions executable, not vague? |
| Auto-delivered overlap | Low | Does it duplicate what SuPi extensions already inject? **Use the Phase 1 Redundancy Risk Assessment as primary evidence.** |

**Quality Scores:**
- **A (90-100)**: Comprehensive, current, actionable
- **B (70-89)**: Good coverage, minor gaps
- **C (50-69)**: Basic info, missing key sections
- **D (30-49)**: Sparse or outdated
- **F (0-29)**: Missing or severely outdated

### Phase 4: Quality Report Output

**ALWAYS output the quality report BEFORE making any updates.**

Format:

```
## CLAUDE.md Quality Report

### Summary
- Files found: X
- Average score: X/100
- Files needing update: X
- Potential token savings: ~X (removing redundant/auto-delivered content)

**Auto-delivered content overlaps are never "minor" or "not worth the churn."** Content that duplicates what SuPi extensions auto-inject wastes tokens every session and MUST be flagged for removal. A single edit that saves ~200 tokens per session pays for itself within a few sessions.

### File-by-File Assessment

#### 1. ./CLAUDE.md (Project Root)
**Score: XX/100 (Grade: X)**

**Context Overlap Review:**
- **Fully redundant (root-level):** [sections already covered by baseline context — applies to root `./CLAUDE.md`]
- **Fully redundant (package-specific):** [sections already covered by baseline context — applies to that package's `CLAUDE.md`]
- **Partially redundant:** [sections with overlap plus human-only value]
- **Unique:** [sections that should stay]
- **Estimated waste:** ~X tokens (characters ÷ 4) of existing content duplicate auto-delivered context — should be removed

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Commands/workflows | X/15 | ... |
| Architecture clarity | X/15 | ... |
| Non-obvious patterns | X/15 | ... |
| Conciseness | X/15 | ... |
| Currency | X/15 | ... |
| Actionability | X/15 | ... |
| Auto-delivered overlap | X/10 | ... |

**Issues:**
- [List specific problems]

**Recommended removals (non-negotiable for auto-delivered content):**
- [List what MUST be removed or compressed, with estimated token savings. Auto-delivered content is never "minor" or "not worth the churn" — it wastes tokens every session and MUST be removed.]

**Recommended additions:**
- [List what should be added]

#### 2. ./packages/api/CLAUDE.md (Package-specific)
...
```

### Phase 5: Targeted Updates

**Core principle: every token must earn its place in the instruction file.** If content doesn't save future sessions more time than it costs to read, remove it. No instruction file should exceed 200 lines — above that, every line must fight for its place against removal.

After outputting the quality report, ask user for confirmation before updating.

**Update Guidelines (Critical):**

1. **Remove or compress unnecessary content first** — Before adding anything, flag sections that MUST be removed or tightened. Never skip removals because of edit churn — a one-time edit that saves tokens every session pays for itself immediately.
   - Routine command listings (`npm install`, `npm test`, `npm run build`) — remove; they're in package.json
   - Package/module inventories that duplicate what `code_brief` auto-delivers — MUST be removed (these waste hundreds of tokens every session)
   - Package layout / project structure sections that just list packages with descriptions — MUST be removed; `code_intelligence` delivers this. Architecture trees that restate what `code_brief` or `code_intelligence` auto-deliver are never acceptable.
   - Verbose explanations where a one-liner suffices — compress
   - Stale or outdated commands, file references, or architecture descriptions — remove

2. **Then propose targeted additions** — Add only genuinely useful, non-obvious info:
   - Non-obvious commands or workflows discovered during analysis. Non-obvious means: gotcha flags (`--unsafe`, `--runInBand`), hook behaviors, ordering requirements, cross-tool workflows. Routine commands with scoped paths (`pnpm vitest run packages/<pkg>/path`) are still routine — they're equally discoverable from the file tree.
   - Gotchas or non-obvious patterns found in code
   - Package relationships that weren't clear
   - Testing approaches that work
   - Configuration quirks

3. **Keep it minimal** - Avoid:
   - Restating what's obvious from the code
   - Generic best practices already covered
   - One-off fixes unlikely to recur
   - Verbose explanations when a one-liner suffices

4. **Show diffs** - For each change, show:
   - Which CLAUDE.md file to update
   - The specific addition (as a diff or quoted block)
   - Brief explanation of why this helps future sessions

**Diff Format:**

```markdown
### Update: ./CLAUDE.md

**Why:** The pre-push hook behavior wasn't documented, causing repeated confusion in CI.

```diff
+ The pre-push hook runs `pnpm verify` — covers both lint and tests; don't run them separately.
```
```

### Phase 6: Apply Updates

After user approval, apply changes using the Edit tool. Preserve existing content structure.

## Templates

See [references/templates.md](references/templates.md) for CLAUDE.md templates by project type.

## Common Issues to Flag

1. **Stale commands**: Non-obvious commands or flags that no longer work
2. **Missing dependencies**: Required tools not mentioned
3. **Outdated architecture**: File structure that's changed
4. **Missing environment setup**: Required env vars or config
5. **Undocumented gotchas**: Non-obvious patterns not captured

## User Tips to Share

When presenting recommendations, remind users:

- **Keep it concise**: CLAUDE.md should be human-readable; dense is better than verbose
- **Actionable commands**: All documented commands should be non-obvious and copy-paste ready; skip routine ones
- **Use `.claude.local.md`**: For personal preferences not shared with team (add to `.gitignore`)
- **Global defaults**: Put user-wide preferences in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`

## What Makes a Great CLAUDE.md

**Key principles:**
- Concise and human-readable
- Non-obvious commands and workflows (gotcha flags, ordering, hooks — not routine build/test)
- Project-specific patterns, not generic advice
- Non-obvious gotchas and warnings

**Recommended sections** (use only what's relevant):
- Non-Obvious Commands & Workflows (gotcha flags, hook behaviors, ordering)
- Architecture (directory structure)
- Key Files (entry points, config)
- Code Style (project conventions)
- Environment (required vars, setup)
- Testing (non-obvious patterns and conventions)
- Gotchas (quirks, common mistakes)
- Workflow (when to do what)
